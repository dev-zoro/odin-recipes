            <h2>Buffalo Chicken Dip Ingredients</h2>
                <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated Buffalo chicken dip with canned chicken:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chicken</strong></li>
                      <p>This Buffalo chicken dip starts with two cans of chunk chicken, making it extra easy and affordable. Of course, you can substitute rotisserie chicken or shredded chicken breasts if you'd prefer.</p>
                    <li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong></li>
                      <p>Make sure the cream cheese is softened for easy incorporation.</p>
                    <li><strong>Ranch Dressing</strong></li>
                      <p>A cup of ranch dressing adds creaminess and tang.</p>
                    <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong></li>
                      <p>Hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's) turns up the heat, mimicking the spicy flavor of Buffalo chicken wings. Use more or less than the recipe calls for to suit your flavor preferences.</p>
                    <li><strong>Cheese</strong></li>
                      <p>Cheddar cheese is melted into the dip, creating a satisfyingly gooey texture and cheesy flavor.</p>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Quantity of Ingredients:</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</li>
                    <li>¾ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</li>
                    <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
                    <li>1 cup ranch dressing</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 bunch celery, cut into 4-inch pieces</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) box chicken-flavored crackers</li>
                  </ul>

                <h2>Directions/Steps of Making:</h2>
                  <ol >
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
                      <p>Heat chicken and hot pepper sauce in a skillet over medium heat until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in cream cheese and ranch dressing.
                        <br>Cook and stir until well blended and warm, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
                      <p>Mix in 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and transfer the mixture to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top.</p>
                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
                      <p>Cover and cook on Low until dip is hot and bubbly, about 35 minutes.</p>
